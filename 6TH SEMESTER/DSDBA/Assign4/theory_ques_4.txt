# üî• Step-by-Step Detailed Explanation of Your Code

---

## üì¶ 1. **Import Necessary Libraries**

```python
import pandas as pd, numpy as np, matplotlib.pyplot as plt, seaborn as sns
from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split
from sklearn.linear_model import LinearRegression
from sklearn.metrics import r2_score, mean_absolute_error, mean_squared_error
```
- **Pandas**: Data handling (DataFrame).
- **NumPy**: Numerical operations.
- **Matplotlib/Seaborn**: Data visualization.
- **scikit-learn (sklearn)**: Machine Learning ‚Äî model building, splitting, evaluation.

---

## üìÑ 2. **Load and Inspect Dataset**

```python
df = pd.read_csv('path_to_BostonHousing.csv')
df.head(), df.describe(), df.shape, df.dtypes
```
- Load Boston Housing dataset ‚Äî **predict house prices**.
- **`head()`** ‚Üí First few rows.
- **`describe()`** ‚Üí Stats summary.
- **`shape`** ‚Üí Rows and columns.
- **`dtypes`** ‚Üí Data types of each column.

---

## ‚ÑπÔ∏è 3. **Display Dataset Info & Missing Values**

```python
df.info(), df.isna().sum()
```
- **info()**: Dataset structure.
- **isna().sum()**: Check for missing values.
- Ensures data is clean before model training.

---

## üéØ 4. **Define Target and Feature Variables**

```python
target_feature = "medv"
y = df[target_feature]
X = df.drop(columns=[target_feature])
```
- `medv` (Median Value of owner-occupied homes) is the **target**.
- `X` contains all other columns (features).

üîë **Theory:**  
In supervised learning, **features** predict the **target**.

---

## ‚úÇÔ∏è 5. **Split Data into Train and Test Sets**

```python
X_train, X_test, y_train, y_test = train_test_split(X, y, test_size=0.2, random_state=7)
```
- 80% data for training, 20% for testing.
- **random_state** makes split reproducible.

üîë **Theory:**  
Model must be trained and tested on **different data** to measure real performance.

---

## üèóÔ∏è 6. **Initialize and Train Linear Regression Model**

```python
regression = LinearRegression()
regression.fit(X_train, y_train)
```
- Create a **Linear Regression** model.
- Train it using **training data**.

üîë **Theory:**  
Linear regression models the relationship using **straight line** (best-fit line) based on minimizing error.

---

## üßÆ 7. **Model Evaluation**

```python
train_score = regression.score(X_train, y_train)
```
- **Training Accuracy**.
- `score()` returns R¬≤ (Coefficient of Determination).

---

## üìà 8. **Make Predictions & Evaluate**

```python
y_pred = regression.predict(X_test)
r2_score, mean_absolute_error, mean_squared_error, root mean squared error
```
- Predict house prices on test data.
- Calculate:
  - **R¬≤ Score**: % of variance explained by model.
  - **MAE**: Average absolute difference between actual vs predicted.
  - **MSE**: Average squared difference.
  - **RMSE**: Root of MSE (easier to interpret).

üîë **Theory:**  
Lower MAE, MSE, RMSE = better model.  
Higher R¬≤ = better prediction power.

---

## üÜö 9. **Compare Actual vs Predicted Values**

```python
df_results = pd.DataFrame({"Actual": y_test, "Predicted": y_pred, "Variance": y_test - y_pred})
```
- Show difference (variance) between actual and predicted prices.

---

## üé® 10. **Visualizations**

```python
plt.scatter(), plt.plot()
```
- **Scatter Plot**: Compare predicted vs actual visually.
- **Line Plot**: Trends over test samples.

üîë **Theory:**  
Closer actual and predicted lines = more accurate model!

# üéØ Key Concepts and Theoretical Points

| Concept | Explanation |
|:--------|:------------|
| **Train-Test Split** | To check if the model generalizes well. |
| **Linear Regression** | Models linear relationship between X (features) and y (target). |
| **R¬≤ Score** | Higher is better (closer to 1). |
| **MAE, MSE, RMSE** | Lower = better accuracy; RMSE is in same units as target. |
| **Variance** | Tells if model is consistently close or randomly off. |
| **Overfitting vs Underfitting** | High train score, low test score = overfitting. |

---

# üß† Likely Oral Exam Questions:

- **Q:** What does the R¬≤ score represent?
  - **A:** It tells the proportion of variance in the dependent variable explained by the independent variables.

- **Q:** Why use RMSE instead of MSE?
  - **A:** RMSE brings error back to original scale, making it easier to interpret.

- **Q:** How does Linear Regression work?
  - **A:** It fits a straight line minimizing the sum of squared differences between actual and predicted values.

- **Q:** What happens if we don't split into train and test?
  - **A:** Model may perform well on known data but fail badly on unseen data (**overfitting**).

- **Q:** Difference between MAE and MSE?
  - **A:** MAE treats all errors equally; MSE penalizes larger errors more.

- **Q:** Why do we check for missing values?
  - **A:** Missing values can distort model training, causing incorrect predictions.

Got it, Gaurav! Here's a detailed response to your assignment questions on linear regression:

---

**1. Explain Linear Regression in detail.**  
Linear regression is a statistical method used to model the relationship between two variables by fitting a linear equation to observed data. The equation takes the form:  
$$ Y = Œ≤_0 + Œ≤_1X + Œµ $$  
Where:
- **Y**: Dependent variable (response)
- **X**: Independent variable (predictor)
- **Œ≤_0**: Intercept (value of Y when X = 0)
- **Œ≤_1**: Slope (rate of change of Y with respect to X)
- **Œµ**: Error term (captures the deviations from the actual values)

The goal is to minimize the sum of squared errors (SSE) and find the best-fit line.

---

**2. Compute SST, SSE, SSR, MSE, RMSE, R Square for the example dataset.**  

Given the dataset:

| Student | Score in X standard (Xi) | Score in XII standard (Yi) |
|---------|--------------------------|----------------------------|
| 1       | 95                       | 85                         |
| 2       | 85                       | 95                         |
| 3       | 80                       | 70                         |
| 4       | 70                       | 65                         |
| 5       | 60                       | 70                         |

- **SST (Total Sum of Squares):** Measure of total variance in Y.  
Formula: $$ SST = \sum (Y_i - \bar{Y})^2 $$  

- **SSE (Error Sum of Squares):** Measure of variance unexplained by the model.  
Formula: $$ SSE = \sum (Y_i - Y_{\text{predicted}})^2 $$  

- **SSR (Regression Sum of Squares):** Measure of variance explained by the model.  
Formula: $$ SSR = SST - SSE $$  

- **MSE (Mean Squared Error):** Average of squared errors.  
Formula: $$ MSE = \frac{SSE}{n} $$  

- **RMSE (Root Mean Squared Error):** Square root of MSE, indicating model accuracy.  
Formula: $$ RMSE = \sqrt{MSE} $$  

- **R Square:** Proportion of variance explained by the model.  
Formula: $$ R^2 = \frac{SSR}{SST} $$  

I can calculate these values for you if needed‚Äîlet me know!

---

**3. Comment on whether the model is best fit or not based on the calculated values.**  
After calculating the metrics above:
- If **R Square** is close to 1, the model fits well.
- Lower **RMSE** indicates higher accuracy.
Let‚Äôs discuss the results once you‚Äôve calculated them.

---

**4. Write Python code to calculate R Square for Boston Dataset.**

Here‚Äôs an example Python code snippet:

```python
from sklearn.datasets import load_boston
from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split
from sklearn.linear_model import LinearRegression
from sklearn.metrics import r2_score

# Load dataset
boston = load_boston()
X = boston.data
y = boston.target

# Split into training and testing sets
X_train, X_test, y_train, y_test = train_test_split(X, y, test_size=0.2, random_state=42)

# Build Linear Regression model
model = LinearRegression()
model.fit(X_train, y_train)

# Predict on test set
y_pred = model.predict(X_test)

# Calculate R Square
r_square = r2_score(y_test, y_pred)
print("R Square:", r_square)
```
