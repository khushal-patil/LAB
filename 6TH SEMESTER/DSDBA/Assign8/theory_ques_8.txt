# ‚ú® Full Explanation ‚Äî Titanic Dataset Code

---

## 1. **Install and Import Libraries**

```python
!pip install seaborn
!pip install matplotlib
```
- `Seaborn` = for **advanced statistical graphics**.
- `Matplotlib` = **basic plotting library** under the hood.
- `pandas`, `numpy` = for **data handling**.

---

## 2. **Load Titanic Dataset**

```python
df = sns.load_dataset('titanic')
```
- Titanic dataset = real-world data about Titanic passengers: age, fare, class, survival etc.

‚úÖ **Key Viva Point:** "It‚Äôs a famous dataset for survival analysis."

---

## 3. **Basic Data Exploration**

```python
df.head()  # first 5 rows
df.info()  # data types, null values
df.isnull().sum()  # count missing values
df.describe()  # basic statistics
df.describe().transpose()
```
‚úÖ **Key Viva Point:** "Always explore data first to understand its structure and missing values."

---

## 4. **Distribution Plots**

```python
sns.distplot(df['fare'],bins=10,kde=True)
sns.distplot(x=df['fare'],bins=20,kde=False)
```
- **Fare distribution**: how passenger fares are spread.
- **KDE** (Kernel Density Estimation): smooth curve showing probability density.

‚úÖ **Key Viva Point:** "Distribution plots show the spread and skewness of numerical data."

---

## 5. **Joint Plots**

```python
sns.jointplot(x=df['age'],y=df['fare'],kind='scatter')
sns.jointplot(x=df['age'],y=df['fare'],kind='hex')
```
- **Scatter/Hexbin plots**: relationships between two numeric variables (Age vs Fare).

‚úÖ **Key Viva Point:** "Joint plots show both correlation and density."

---

## 6. **Counting Fares Below/Above 100**

Simple Python `for-loop` counting.

‚úÖ **Key Viva Point:** "Basic analysis helps in summarizing patterns manually."

---

## 7. **Counting Passenger Classes**

```python
for i in df['pclass']:
  ...
```
- Counts frequency of each passenger class: 1st, 2nd, 3rd.

‚úÖ **Key Viva Point:** "Categorical distribution is crucial for class-based analysis."

---

## 8. **Rug Plot**

```python
sns.rugplot(x=df['age'],y=df['fare'])
```
- **Tiny ticks** along axes to show distribution.

‚úÖ **Key Viva Point:** "Rug plots show data density."

---

## 9. **Bar and Count Plots**

```python
sns.countplot(x=df['class'],hue='survived')
```
- Shows count of classes, split by survival.

‚úÖ **Key Viva Point:** "Countplots are used for categorical variable counts."

---

## 10. **Box Plot**

```python
sns.boxplot(x=df['class'],y=df['age'])
```
- Summarizes data via **quartiles** and **outliers**.

‚úÖ **Key Viva Point:** "Boxplots reveal the spread, median, and outliers."

---

## 11. **Violin Plot**

```python
sns.violinplot(x=df['class'],y=df['age'])
```
- Combines **boxplot** + **KDE** into one.

‚úÖ **Key Viva Point:** "Violin plots show distribution + density together."

---

## 12. **Swarm Plot**

```python
sns.swarmplot(x=df['class'],y=df['age'])
```
- Points scattered without overlap.

‚úÖ **Key Viva Point:** "Swarmplots visualize all points while maintaining class distinction."

---

## 13. **Histplot**

```python
sns.histplot(x=df['fare'],bins=10,hue='survived')
```
- Histogram of fare distribution grouped by survival.

‚úÖ **Key Viva Point:** "Histograms show frequency distributions."

---

## 14. **Heatmap**

```python
corr = df.corr(numeric_only=True)
sns.heatmap(corr,annot=True)
```
- Shows correlation matrix visually.

‚úÖ **Key Viva Point:** "Heatmaps reveal relationships between numeric variables."

---

## 15. **Strip Plot**

```python
sns.stripplot(x='class',y='fare')
```
- Jittered scatter plots for small datasets.

‚úÖ **Key Viva Point:** "Stripplots are great for seeing exact individual points."

---

## 16. **Density Chart (KDE Plot)**

```python
sns.kdeplot(data=df, x="fare", hue="class", fill=True)
```
- Smoothed line plots.

‚úÖ **Key Viva Point:** "KDE shows the probability density function of continuous variables."

---

## 17. **Treemap (Plotly)**

```python
ex.treemap(df, path=["class", "sex"], values="fare")
```
- Visualizes hierarchical data as nested rectangles.

‚úÖ **Key Viva Point:** "Treemaps represent parts of a whole."

---

## 18. **Radar Chart**

```python
Polar Plot for class-wise survival, fare, and age.
```
- Circular plot where each axis represents a variable.

‚úÖ **Key Viva Point:** "Radar charts compare multivariate data."

---

## 19. **Bubble Chart**

```python
sns.scatterplot(data=grouped, x="class", y="fare", size="survived", hue="sex")
```
- Size of the point represents another variable (survived count).

‚úÖ **Key Viva Point:** "Bubble charts add an extra dimension (size) to scatterplots."

---

## 20. **Pie Chart**

```python
plt.pie(class_counts, labels=class_counts.index,autopct="%1.1f%%")
```
- Shows proportion of each passenger class.

‚úÖ **Key Viva Point:** "Pie charts show parts of a whole but are less precise than bar charts."

---

## 21. **Area Chart**

```python
fare_by_age_class.plot(kind="area")
```
- Stacked areas showing changes over age groups.

‚úÖ **Key Viva Point:** "Area charts emphasize the total quantity and part-whole relationships."

---

## 22. **Waterfall Chart**

```python
go.Waterfall()
```
- Breaks down data across stages.

‚úÖ **Key Viva Point:** "Waterfall charts show cumulative effect of sequentially introduced values."

Here‚Äôs a detailed breakdown of the answers based on the image content:

---

### **1. List out different types of plots to find patterns in data**
Various types of plots can help uncover patterns in datasets:
- **Distribution Plots**: Histogram, KDE (Kernel Density Estimate), and Rug plot.
- **Relational Plots**: Scatter plot and Line plot.
- **Categorical Plots**: Box plot, Violin plot, Swarm plot, Strip plot, and Bar plot.
- **Other Plots**: Heatmap (for correlations), Pair plot, and Joint plot.

---

### **2. Explain when to use distribution plots and categorical plots**
- **Distribution Plots**: Useful to observe the spread or distribution of numerical data. For example, histograms are great for understanding frequency, and KDE plots are excellent for visualizing probability densities.
- **Categorical Plots**: Useful to analyze relationships between categorical variables or between categorical and numerical variables. For instance:
  - Use a Box plot for comparing distributions.
  - Violin plots are perfect when you want to visualize both distribution and probability density across categories.

---

### **3. Write the conclusion from the swarm plot (Titanic dataset)**
Based on the swarm plot:
- The age distribution varies for **male** and **female** passengers.
- **Survival trends**:
  - Many younger individuals survived, especially children.
  - Females appear to have higher survival rates compared to males, reflecting prioritization during rescue efforts.

The swarm plot offers clear insights into how survival was influenced by age and gender.

---

### **4. Parameter to add another categorical variable to a violin plot**
The parameter used is `hue`. It allows differentiation of subcategories within a category by assigning distinct colors.

**Syntax Example**:
```python
import seaborn as sns
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

# Example dataset: Titanic
sns.violinplot(x="Class", y="Age", hue="Survived", data=titanic, split=True)
plt.show()
```

In the above code:
- `hue="Survived"` adds survival status as another categorical variable.
- `split=True` overlays the categories for better comparison.
