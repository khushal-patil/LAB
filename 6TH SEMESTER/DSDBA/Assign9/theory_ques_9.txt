Of course!  
I'll break it down **super clearly** + give you **viva-ready key points** so you **crush the oral exam** like a **pro analyst** ðŸš€.

# âœ¨ Full Explanation â€” Titanic Dataset Code (Advanced Boxplot and Outlier Handling)

---

## 1. **Install and Import**

```python
!pip install seaborn
import pandas as pd
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
import seaborn as sns
import numpy as np
```
âœ… **Key Viva Point:**  
_"Seaborn is used for statistical plots; Pandas handles data; Matplotlib handles charts."_

---

## 2. **Load Dataset**

```python
df = sns.load_dataset("titanic")
```
âœ… **Key Viva Point:**  
_"Titanic dataset is real-world data for survival prediction. It contains categorical and numerical variables."_

---

## 3. **Check Missing Values**

```python
df.isnull().sum()
```
âœ… **Key Viva Point:**  
_"Before any analysis, missing values must be identified and handled appropriately."_

---

## 4. **Handle Missing Age Values**

```python
df['age'] = df['age'].fillna(df['age'].mean())
```
- Fill missing 'age' values with the **mean** age.

âœ… **Key Viva Point:**  
_"Using mean for missing numerical data is a common imputation technique to avoid bias."_

---

## 5. **Plot Initial Boxplot**

```python
plt.figure(figsize=(10,10))
sns.boxplot(data=df, x='sex', y='age', hue='survived', palette='coolwarm')
plt.title("Boxplot for gender distribution with respect to age")
plt.show()
```
- **Boxplot** shows **median, quartiles, outliers** by gender and survival.

âœ… **Key Viva Point:**  
_"Boxplots visually represent the spread and detect outliers easily."_

âœ… **Extra Viva Tip:**  
_"Hue separates survived and non-survived passengers by color coding."_

---

## 6. **Get Dataset Info**

```python
df.info()
```
- Shows types of data: numerical, categorical.

âœ… **Key Viva Point:**  
_"Always check dtypes to know which statistical methods are applicable."_

---

## 7. **Outlier Detection â€” Using IQR Method**

```python
Q1 = df['age'].quantile(0.25)
Q3 = df['age'].quantile(0.75)
IQR = Q3 - Q1
upper_bound = Q3 + 1.5 * IQR
lower_bound = Q1 - 1.5 * IQR
outliers = df[(df['age'] < lower_bound) | (df['age'] > upper_bound)]
```
- IQR = Interquartile Range = (Q3 - Q1)
- **Outliers**: points outside [Q1 - 1.5Ã—IQR, Q3 + 1.5Ã—IQR]

âœ… **Key Viva Point:**  
_"IQR method detects extreme values that deviate significantly from the majority."_

---

## 8. **Count Outliers**

```python
num_outliers = len(outliers)
print("No. of Outliers", num_outliers)
```
- Find how many outliers exist.

âœ… **Key Viva Point:**  
_"Knowing how many outliers exist informs data cleaning decisions."_

---

## 9. **Replace Outliers with Median**

```python
median_age = df['age'].median()
df.loc[(df['age'] < lower_bound)  | (df['age'] >upper_bound), 'age'] = median_age
```
- Replace **extreme ages** with **median** value (less sensitive to outliers than mean).

âœ… **Key Viva Point:**  
_"Median imputation preserves dataset stability while handling extremes."_

---

## 10. **Verify if Outliers Removed**

```python
outliers = df[(df['age'] < lower_bound) | (df['age'] > upper_bound)]
print("No. of Outliers", num_outliers)
```
âœ… **Key Viva Point:**  
_"After cleaning, verify results to ensure dataset quality."_

---

## 11. **Replot Boxplot (Post Cleaning)**

```python
plt.figure(figsize=(10,10))
sns.boxplot(data=df, x='sex', y='age', hue='survived', palette='coolwarm')
plt.title("Boxplot for gender distribution with respect to age")
plt.ylabel('Count')
plt.show()
```
âœ… **Key Viva Point:**  
_"Post-cleaning visualizations validate if data has improved (outliers reduced)."_

---

## 12. **Group and Count by Sex and Survival**

```python
counts = df.groupby(['sex', 'survived']).size().unstack()
print(counts)
```
- Group by **sex** and **survival**, count passengers.

âœ… **Key Viva Point:**  
_"Grouping reveals patterns like survival rates across genders."_

# ðŸŽ¯ Critical Viva Concepts (Short Ready-to-Speak)

| Concept | Speak This During Viva |
|:---|:---|
| Missing Value Treatment | "Imputed missing ages with mean to preserve dataset size." |
| Boxplot | "Shows median, spread, and identifies outliers visually." |
| Outlier Detection | "Used IQR method; points outside Q1-1.5Ã—IQR or Q3+1.5Ã—IQR are outliers." |
| Outlier Treatment | "Replaced outlier ages with median to minimize distortion." |
| GroupBy Analysis | "Grouped by gender and survival to observe demographic patterns." |

# ðŸ§  Extra Smart Tips (Answer Like a Genius)

- _"I chose median over mean for outlier correction because median is robust to skewness."_
- _"Boxplots and IQR are standard exploratory tools to ensure data quality."_
- _"Removing or correcting outliers helps in avoiding bias in predictive modeling."_

Here are answers to the two assignments provided in the images you uploaded:

---

### **Assignment 1: Data Visualization-II**

1. **Explain Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):**
   - EDA is the initial step in analyzing data to summarize its main characteristics, often using visual methods. It helps uncover patterns, detect anomalies, and check assumptions using statistical graphics and visualization tools.

2. **Explain Univariate Analysis:**
   - It focuses on analyzing a single variable. Common techniques include histograms, boxplots, and summary statistics like mean, median, and standard deviation.

3. **What is Multivariate Analysis? Explain.**
   - Multivariate analysis examines multiple variables simultaneously to understand relationships between them. Examples include scatterplots, heatmaps for correlation, and dimensionality reduction techniques like PCA (Principal Component Analysis).

4. **How is Distplot and Boxplot created?**
   - **Distplot:** Visualizes the distribution of a single variable along with an optional kernel density estimate (KDE).
     ```python
     import seaborn as sns
     import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
     sns.distplot(data['column_name'], kde=True)
     plt.show()
     ```
   - **Boxplot:** Summarizes data by showing the median, quartiles, and outliers.
     ```python
     sns.boxplot(x='gender', y='age', data=titanic)
     plt.show()
     ```

### **Assignment 2: Naive Bayes Classifier**

1. **Explain Concepts of Naive Bayes Classifier:**
   - Naive Bayes is a supervised classification algorithm based on Bayes' theorem, which uses conditional probabilities. The "naive" assumption is that all features are independent, which simplifies computations.

2. **Find the Probability of Car Theft for the Given Scenario (Red, SUV, Domestic):**
   - Use conditional probabilities from the provided dataset:
     \[
     P(\text{Theft | Red, SUV, Domestic}) = P(\text{Red | Theft}) \times P(\text{SUV | Theft}) \times P(\text{Domestic | Theft}) \times P(\text{Theft})
     \]
   - Calculate each component by counting occurrences in the table. Finally, normalize the result using the probabilities for stolen and not stolen scenarios.

3. **Python Code for Preprocessing:**
   Here's an example code snippet:
   ```python
   import pandas as pd
   from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split

   # Create dataset
   data = {
       'Color': ['Red', 'Red', 'Red', 'Yellow', 'Yellow', 'Yellow', 'Yellow', 'Yellow', 'Red', 'Red'],
       'Type': ['Sports', 'Sports', 'Sports', 'Sports', 'Sports', 'SUV', 'SUV', 'SUV', 'SUV', 'SUV'],
       'Origin': ['Domestic', 'Domestic', 'Domestic', 'Domestic', 'Imported', 'Imported', 'Imported', 'Domestic', 'Imported', 'Domestic'],
       'Stolen': ['Yes', 'No', 'Yes', 'No', 'Yes', 'Yes', 'No', 'No', 'Yes', 'No']
   }

   df = pd.DataFrame(data)

   # Encode categorical variables
   df['Color'] = df['Color'].map({'Red': 0, 'Yellow': 1})
   df['Type'] = df['Type'].map({'Sports': 0, 'SUV': 1})
   df['Origin'] = df['Origin'].map({'Domestic': 0, 'Imported': 1})
   df['Stolen'] = df['Stolen'].map({'Yes': 1, 'No': 0})

   # Split data into training and testing sets
   X = df[['Color', 'Type', 'Origin']]
   y = df['Stolen']
   X_train, X_test, y_train, y_test = train_test_split(X, y, test_size=0.3, random_state=42)

   print("Processed Data:", df)
   ```

This code preprocesses the dataset to make it usable for machine learning algorithms.
