Of course! Letâ€™s **master this step-by-step** so youâ€™re ready to **nail** your oral exam confidently. ðŸš€  
(I'm explaining it smartly so you can **speak fluently and impressively**!)

---

# âœ¨ Detailed Explanation of Your Code:

---

## 1. **Installing and Importing NLTK:**

```python
!pip install nltk
import nltk
import re
```
- `nltk` (Natural Language Toolkit) = powerful **library for text processing** like tokenization, stemming, etc.
- `re` = module for **regular expressions** (pattern matching).

---

## 2. **Downloading NLTK Resources:**

```python
nltk.download('punkt')  # for tokenization
nltk.download('stopwords')  # common words like "the", "is"
nltk.download('wordnet')  # database for lemmatization
nltk.download('averaged_perceptron_tagger')  # part-of-speech tagging
nltk.download('punkt_tab')  # (mistaken, no need actually)
```
âœ… Ensures all language models are available for processing.

---

## 3. **Text Input:**

```python
text = "Hi, Everyone myself khushal patil..."
```
- Simple paragraph about yourself.

---

## 4. **Sentence Tokenization:**

```python
from nltk.tokenize import sent_tokenize
tokenized_text = sent_tokenize(text)
```
- Breaks the paragraph into **individual sentences**.
- Eg: ["Hi, Everyone...", "I am currently pursuing..."]

âœ… **Key Theory**: "Tokenization divides a large text into smaller parts."

---

## 5. **Word Tokenization:**

```python
from nltk.tokenize import word_tokenize
word_tokenize_text = word_tokenize(text)
```
- Breaks sentences into **individual words and punctuation**.

âœ… **Key Theory**: "It helps further in stopword removal, stemming, and feature extraction."

---

## 6. **Stopwords Handling:**

```python
from nltk.corpus import stopwords
stop_words = set(stopwords.words("english"))
```
- `stopwords` = very **common words** (like is, am, are) that don't add much meaning.

âœ… **Key Theory**: "Removing stopwords cleans the data and reduces noise."

---

## 7. **Text Cleaning with Regex:**

```python
text = re.sub('[^a-zA-Z]',' ',text)
```
- Removes everything except alphabets.
- Cleans numbers, punctuations.

---

## 8. **Filtering Non-Stop Words:**

```python
tokens = word_tokenize(text.lower())
filtered_text = [w for w in tokens if w not in stop_words]
```
- Converts text to **lowercase** and removes **stopwords**.

âœ… **Key Theory**: "Lowercasing standardizes the text for better matching."

---

## 9. **Stemming:**

```python
from nltk.stem import PorterStemmer
ps = PorterStemmer()
rootWord = ps.stem("writes")  # example
```
- Reduces words to their **base form** by chopping off endings.
- Eg: "writing" âž” "write", "writes" âž” "write".

âœ… **Key Theory**: "Stemming is rule-based and often faster but less accurate."

---

## 10. **Lemmatization:**

```python
from nltk.stem import WordNetLemmatizer
wordnet_lemmatizer = WordNetLemmatizer()
```
- Converts words to **dictionary root form** using grammar rules.
- Eg: "cries" âž” "cry", "studies" âž” "study".

âœ… **Key Theory**: "Lemmatization is smarter than stemming because it uses context."

---

## 11. **TF (Term Frequency) Calculation:**

```python
bagOfWordsA = documentA.split(' ')
bagOfWordsB = documentB.split(' ')
```
- Splits both documents into **individual words**.

âœ… **Key Theory**: "Bag of Words = unordered collection of words with their frequency."

---
## 12. **Unique Words Set:**

```python
uniqueWords = set(bagOfWordsA).union(set(bagOfWordsB))
```
- Collects all **unique words** from both documents.
  
---

## 13. **Creating Word Counts:**

```python
numOfWordsA = dict.fromkeys(uniqueWords, 0)
```
- Creates a **dictionary** with all unique words initialized to 0.
- Then counts occurrences.

---

## 14. **Defining TF Function:**

```python
def computeTF(wordDict, bagOfWords):
    tfDict = {}
    bagOfWordsCount = len(bagOfWords)
    for word, count in wordDict.items():
        tfDict[word] = count / float(bagOfWordsCount)
    return tfDict
```
- **TF (Term Frequency)** = (Number of times word appears) Ã· (Total number of words).

âœ… **Key Theory**: "TF shows how important a word is in a document."

---

## 15. **Inverse Document Frequency (IDF):**

```python
def computeIDF(documents):
    idfDict = dict.fromkeys(documents[0].keys(), 0)
    ...
    idfDict[word] = math.log(N / float(val))
```
- **IDF** tells **how rare** a word is across all documents.
- If a word appears in **many documents**, its IDF value will be low.

âœ… **Key Theory**: "TF-IDF highlights words that are **important** in one document but **rare** across others."

# ðŸŽ¯ Quick Key Points You Should Say in Viva:

| Concept | Key Point (Short Answer for Oral) |
|:---|:---|
| Tokenization | Breaking text into sentences/words |
| Stopwords | Removing common words to focus on important ones |
| Stemming | Cutting words to their root (write, writes â†’ write) |
| Lemmatization | More intelligent stemming using grammar rules |
| Bag of Words | Words converted into a "count dictionary" |
| TF | How often a word appears in a document |
| IDF | How rare a word is across all documents |
| TF-IDF | TF multiplied by IDF to find important words |

# ðŸ’¬ If external asks random questions like:

ðŸ”¹**Q:** Why clean text before analysis?  
ðŸ”¹**A:** To remove noise, standardize, and improve model performance.

ðŸ”¹**Q:** Stemming vs Lemmatization?  
ðŸ”¹**A:** Stemming is fast and rule-based. Lemmatization is slow but more accurate using grammar.

ðŸ”¹**Q:** Why TF-IDF?  
ðŸ”¹**A:** To highlight important words that are frequent in one document but rare in others.

Let's tackle the questions in the image step-by-step:

---

### **1. Basic Concepts of Text Analytics**
Text Analytics is the process of extracting meaningful insights and patterns from textual data. It involves:
- **Preprocessing**: Steps like tokenization, stop-word removal, stemming, and lemmatization to clean data.
- **Text Representation**: Converting text into numerical forms like TFIDF or word embeddings for analysis.
- **Analysis**: Applying machine learning or statistical models to understand sentiment, topics, trends, etc.

Applications include sentiment analysis, topic modeling, and spam detection.

---

### **2. Explain Inverse Document Frequency**
Inverse Document Frequency (IDF) measures how important a word is across multiple documents. It balances the Term Frequency (TF) by reducing the weight of common words across documents.

The formula is:
\[
\text{IDF}(t) = \log \left( \frac{\text{Total Documents}}{\text{Documents Containing t}} \right)
\]

**Example**:
If a word appears in 2 out of 10 documents:
\[
\text{IDF}(t) = \log \left( \frac{10}{2} \right) = \log(5)
\]

IDF helps prioritize unique, informative words.

---

### **3. Perform Stemming and Lemmatization**
For text: *"studies studying cries cry"*
- **Stemming** (focuses on word root):
  - Output: "studi", "study", "cri", "cri"
- **Lemmatization** (focuses on dictionary form):
  - Output: "study", "studying", "cry", "cry"

**Difference**:
- Stemming is faster but can produce non-meaningful roots.
- Lemmatization is slower but context-aware and provides meaningful words.

---

### **4. Python Code for Stop Word Removal and TFIDF Calculation**
Here's how you can preprocess the documents:

```python
from sklearn.feature_extraction.text import TfidfVectorizer
from nltk.corpus import stopwords
import nltk

# Ensure you download the stopwords
nltk.download('stopwords')

# Documents
documents = [
    "Jupiter is the largest Planet",
    "Mars is the fourth planet from the Sun"
]

# Lowercase and remove stop words
stop_words = set(stopwords.words('english'))
processed_docs = [
    ' '.join([word.lower() for word in doc.split() if word.lower() not in stop_words])
    for doc in documents
]

# TFIDF Calculation
vectorizer = TfidfVectorizer()
tfidf_matrix = vectorizer.fit_transform(processed_docs)

# Display TFIDF scores
features = vectorizer.get_feature_names_out()
print("TFIDF Scores:")
for doc_index, doc in enumerate(tfidf_matrix.toarray()):
    print(f"Document {doc_index + 1}:")
    for feature_index, score in enumerate(doc):
        print(f"{features[feature_index]}: {score:.3f}")
```

This code:
1. Converts text to lowercase.
2. Removes stop words using NLTK's stop-word list.
3. Computes TFIDF scores for the processed text.
