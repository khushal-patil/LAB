Here is a **detailed viva-style theory Q\&A** set based on your **Lenskart Chatbot** Python code. This will help an external examiner ask meaningful oral questions and evaluate your understanding of chatbot development, NLP, and basic programming concepts.

---

### üîπ **General Viva Questions**

**Q1: What is the primary purpose of this Python script?**
**A:** This script simulates a rule-based chatbot for Lenskart that can assist users with product queries, order tracking, store locations, return policies, and offers using keyword-based intent detection.

**Q2: What type of chatbot is implemented here: rule-based or AI-based?**
**A:** This is a **rule-based chatbot**, which relies on keyword matching and pre-defined responses to detect user intent and provide relevant answers.

---

### üîπ **Functional Questions**

**Q3: How does the chatbot detect user intent?**
**A:** It uses the `detect_intent()` function, which searches for predefined keywords in the user input using regular expressions (`re.search`). Based on matches, it classifies the message into one of the defined intents (e.g., greeting, products, track\_order).

**Q4: What is the purpose of the `context` dictionary?**
**A:** `context` stores temporary memory like:

* The last detected intent (`last_intent`)
* Last order ID or city mentioned
* Fallback count for tracking repeated misunderstandings

It helps handle follow-up responses (e.g., waiting for an order ID or a city name after asking).

**Q5: How does the chatbot handle unknown inputs?**
**A:** If no keyword is detected, it defaults to the `"fallback"` intent. If fallback occurs more than once consecutively, it responds with help suggestions.

---

### üîπ **NLP / Regex Questions**

**Q6: How is regular expression used in this chatbot?**
**A:** Regex is used in `detect_intent()` to match whole-word keywords in user input and in `get_response()` to extract order IDs using patterns like `lk\d{5,}` (e.g., LK12345).

**Q7: How does the bot extract order IDs from user input?**
**A:** It uses `re.search()` with the regex pattern `lk\d{5,}` to find order IDs like "LK12345".

---

### üîπ **Intent-Specific Questions**

**Q8: How is order tracking handled?**
**A:** When the intent is `"track_order"`, the bot asks for an order ID. On the next message, if the `last_intent` is `track_order` and an ID like "LK12345" is found, it confirms the order status using a follow-up message.

**Q9: How does the chatbot respond to store location queries?**
**A:** If the user mentions a city after asking for a store, and it's recognized from a list of known cities (e.g., "Mumbai"), it provides predefined store locations in that city.

**Q10: How are offers or promotions handled?**
**A:** If the input contains words like "discount", "deal", or "offer", the chatbot randomly chooses from a list of promotional responses.

---

### üîπ **Design & UX Questions**

**Q11: How does the chatbot ensure variety in responses?**
**A:** By using `random.choice()` on lists of responses for each intent, the chatbot delivers more human-like, varied replies to similar queries.

**Q12: What happens when the user types "exit" or "bye"?**
**A:** The main loop checks for keywords like "exit", "quit", or "bye", prints a goodbye message, and breaks the loop to end the session.

---

### üîπ **Advanced/Extension Questions**

**Q13: How would you extend this chatbot to support FAQs dynamically from a database?**
**A:** Replace the static `responses` dictionary with a database or JSON file. Use NLP models (like spaCy or transformers) for better question matching.

**Q14: Can this chatbot handle voice inputs or API integration?**
**A:** Not directly. But the logic can be adapted into a Flask or FastAPI web service, and integrated with voice/text interfaces like WhatsApp or Google Assistant via APIs.

**Q15: What are some limitations of this chatbot?**
**A:**

* Limited to predefined keywords and patterns
* Cannot understand paraphrased or complex language
* No learning or memory beyond the session
* Doesn‚Äôt support natural dialogue flow (e.g., long conversations)

# **Chatbots & NLP Applications: Comprehensive Guide**

## **1. What is a Chatbot?**

### **Definition**
A **chatbot** is an AI-powered software application designed to simulate human-like conversations with users via text or voice interfaces. It uses **Natural Language Processing (NLP)** to understand, interpret, and respond to user queries.

### **Types of Chatbots**
1. **Rule-Based Chatbots**  
   - Follow predefined decision trees  
   - Example: Basic customer service bots ("Press 1 for sales")  

2. **AI-Powered Chatbots**  
   - Use NLP/Machine Learning  
   - Example: ChatGPT, Google Bard  

### **How Chatbots Work**
```
