Here is a **comprehensive viva-style Q\&A guide** for your **Greedy Algorithm Application Code** covering **Selection Sort**, **Job Scheduling**, **Prim's MST**, and **Kruskal's MST**. This will prepare you to confidently answer theory-based and implementation-specific questions during oral exams.

## üßµ **PART 1: Selection Sort**

**Q1. What is selection sort?**
**A:** Selection sort is a comparison-based sorting algorithm that repeatedly selects the minimum element from the unsorted part and places it at the beginning. It divides the array into sorted and unsorted parts.

**Q2. What is the time complexity of selection sort?**
**A:**

* Worst case: **O(n¬≤)**
* Best case: **O(n¬≤)** (even if sorted)
* Space: **O(1)** (in-place)

**Q3. Is selection sort stable?**
**A:** No, because it may swap non-adjacent elements and change their order.

**Q4. Where is selection sort useful?**
**A:** In small datasets where memory usage is a priority over performance.

---

## üßµ **PART 2: Job Scheduling Problem**

**Q5. What is the job scheduling problem?**
**A:** Given a set of jobs with deadlines and profits, schedule jobs to maximize total profit ensuring no two jobs overlap and each takes unit time.

**Q6. What strategy is used here?**
**A:** **Greedy Algorithm** ‚Äî Sort jobs by descending profit and assign each to the latest available time slot before its deadline.

**Q7. What is the time complexity?**
**A:**

* Sorting: O(n log n)
* Slot filling: O(n¬≤) (can be optimized with DSU to O(n log n))

**Q8. Why do we schedule from latest possible slot?**
**A:** To keep earlier slots free for other jobs with tighter deadlines, maximizing job count and profit.

**Q9. Can multiple jobs be done at same time?**
**A:** No, each time slot can hold only one job.

---

## üßµ **PART 3: Prim‚Äôs Algorithm (Adjacency List)**

**Q10. What is Prim‚Äôs algorithm?**
**A:** A greedy algorithm to find the Minimum Spanning Tree (MST) of a connected weighted graph by growing MST one vertex at a time using the minimum edge.

**Q11. What data structure is used?**
**A:**

* **Min-heap** (priority queue) for selecting the next edge with the smallest weight
* **Visited array** to track included vertices

**Q12. Why is the first edge initialized with weight 0?**
**A:** It acts as a dummy to start the MST from any vertex.

**Q13. Time and space complexity?**
**A:**

* Time: **O(E log V)** with min-heap and adjacency list
* Space: O(V + E)

**Q14. When should you use Prim‚Äôs algorithm?**
**A:** Best when the graph is **dense**, i.e., has many edges.

---

## üßµ **PART 4: Kruskal‚Äôs Algorithm**

**Q15. What is Kruskal‚Äôs algorithm?**
**A:** A greedy algorithm that sorts all edges by weight and adds them to the MST if they don‚Äôt form a cycle.

**Q16. How are cycles avoided?**
**A:** Using **Disjoint Set Union (DSU)** or Union-Find with `find` and `union` operations.

**Q17. How does DSU work?**
**A:**

* `find(u)` returns the representative of the set u belongs to
* `union(u, v)` joins the sets containing u and v

**Q18. Time complexity?**
**A:**

* Sorting edges: **O(E log E)**
* Union-Find: nearly **O(1)** with optimizations

**Q19. When is Kruskal‚Äôs preferred over Prim‚Äôs?**
**A:** When the graph is **sparse**, i.e., fewer edges.

# **Greedy Algorithms: Detailed Explanation**

## **1. Definition**
A **greedy algorithm** is a problem-solving approach that makes the **locally optimal choice** at each step with the hope of finding a global optimum. It never reconsider its choices, always taking the best immediate (greedy) option available.

## **2. Key Characteristics of Greedy Algorithms**
‚úî **Makes locally optimal choices** at each step  
‚úî **Never revisits or reverses decisions** (no backtracking)  
‚úî **Top-down approach** (builds solution step-by-step)  
‚úî **Doesn't guarantee global optimum** (but often finds good approximations)  
‚úî **Efficient** (usually faster than dynamic programming)  

### **Example Problems:**
- **Coin Change Problem** (Minimum coins for a given amount)
- **Huffman Coding** (Data compression)
- **Dijkstra's Algorithm** (Shortest path in graphs)
- **Kruskal's/Prim's Algorithm** (Minimum Spanning Tree)
- **Activity Selection Problem** (Scheduling)

---

## **3. Advantages of Greedy Method**
‚úÖ **Simple & Easy to Implement**  
‚úÖ **Fast Execution** (Low time complexity in many cases)  
‚úÖ **Memory Efficient** (No need to store past decisions)  
‚úÖ **Works Well for Optimization Problems** (e.g., Minimum Spanning Tree)  

### **Example Where Greedy Works Perfectly:**
**Activity Selection Problem**  
- Given activities with start/end times, select max number of non-overlapping activities.  
- Greedy choice: Always pick the activity with the **earliest finish time**.  
- **Optimal solution guaranteed** for this problem.  

---

## **4. Disadvantages of Greedy Method**
‚ùå **Not Always Optimal** (May get stuck in local optima)  
‚ùå **Requires Problem-Specific Proof** (Must verify if greedy choice leads to global optimum)  
‚ùå **Limited Applicability** (Only works for problems with greedy-choice property)  

### **Example Where Greedy Fails:**
**Coin Change Problem (General Case)**  
- Coins: {1, 3, 4}, Target: 6  
- Greedy picks: 4 ‚Üí 1 ‚Üí 1 (Total coins = 3)  
- **Optimal solution:** 3 + 3 (Total coins = 2)  

---

## **5. Time & Space Complexity**
| **Algorithm**       | **Time Complexity** | **Space Complexity** |  
|---------------------|---------------------|----------------------|  
| **Huffman Coding**  | O(n log n)          | O(n)                 |  
| **Dijkstra's**      | O(V¬≤) (Basic)       | O(V)                 |  
| **Kruskal's MST**   | O(E log E)          | O(E)                 |  
| **Prim's MST**      | O(E log V)          | O(V)                 |  

---

## **6. Applications**
- **Networking:** Dijkstra's algorithm for shortest path routing  
- **Data Compression:** Huffman coding for file compression  
- **Scheduling:** Activity selection, job sequencing  
- **Finance:** Coin change problems (with certain coin systems)  

---

## **7. When to Use Greedy?**
‚úî Problem exhibits **optimal substructure** (solution depends on optimal sub-solutions)  
‚úî Problem has the **greedy-choice property** (local optimum ‚Üí global optimum)  
‚úî Efficiency is prioritized over guaranteed optimality  

### **Example:**
**Fractional Knapsack Problem**  
- Greedy works (choose items with highest value/weight ratio first).  
- **0/1 Knapsack Problem** (no fractions) ‚Üí Greedy fails, DP required.  

---

## **8. Key Takeaways**
- Greedy algorithms are **fast but not always optimal**.  
- They work best for problems where **local choices lead to global solutions**.  
- Always verify if the problem has the **greedy-choice property** before implementation.
