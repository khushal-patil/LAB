Here are high-impact **viva questions and answers** based on your graph code — **ideal for oral exams** and covering all critical concepts:

---

### 🔍 **Graph Basics**

**Q1. What is a graph and how is it represented here?**
**A:** A graph is a collection of vertices (nodes) and edges (connections). In this code, it's represented using an **adjacency list**, implemented with a Python dictionary.

---

### 🧩 **Graph Operations**

**Q2. How do you add and remove a vertex?**
**A:** Adding a vertex inserts a new key in the adjacency list if it doesn't already exist. Removing a vertex deletes the key and also removes the vertex from all neighbor lists.

**Q3. How is an edge added or removed?**
**A:** To add an edge between `u` and `v`, both are added to each other's adjacency list (undirected). To remove it, both `u` and `v` are deleted from each other's list.

---

### 🔁 **Traversals**

**Q4. What is the difference between DFS and BFS?**
**A:**

* **DFS** (Depth First Search) goes deep before backtracking; it's recursive.
* **BFS** (Breadth First Search) explores neighbors level by level; it's iterative or recursive using a queue.

**Q5. Why is BFS implemented both iteratively and recursively here?**
**A:** To demonstrate both possible approaches: iterative uses a queue explicitly, recursive simulates it with function calls and a helper function.

---

### 🧠 **Logical Checks**

**Q6. How do you check if a path exists between two vertices?**
**A:** Using a recursive DFS-based function `has_path(u, v)` that searches from `u` to `v` and returns `True` if a path is found.

**Q7. How are the number of vertices and edges counted?**
**A:**

* Vertices = number of keys in the graph dictionary.
* Edges = sum of lengths of all adjacency lists divided by 2 (since each edge is counted twice in an undirected graph).

---

### 🧪 **Code Understanding**

**Q8. Why is `deque` used in BFS?**
**A:** `deque` (double-ended queue) allows efficient O(1) time appends and pops from both ends, ideal for queue operations in BFS.

**Q9. What happens if you try to remove a vertex or edge that doesn’t exist?**
**A:** The code checks for existence using `if` statements, avoiding errors by only removing if the vertex or edge exists.

---

### 🧵 **Design and Extensibility**

**Q10. Is this graph directed or undirected? How would you change it to be directed?**
**A:** It's undirected. To make it directed, **remove the second insertion** in `add_edge` (i.e., `self.graph[v].append(u)`).

**Q11. Can this implementation handle weighted graphs?**
**A:** Not currently. To support weights, change each list to store tuples: `(neighbor, weight)` instead of just `neighbor`.

---

### 🔄 **Algorithms**

**Q12. Is DFS implemented recursively or iteratively?**
**A:** DFS is implemented recursively using a visited set to avoid cycles.

**Q13. What will happen if there is a cycle in the graph?**
**A:** Both DFS and BFS handle cycles correctly by marking visited nodes, preventing infinite loops.

###############################################################################################################
Based on the screenshot, the questions revolve around **Depth-First Search (DFS) and Breadth-First Search (BFS)** algorithms. Below, I provide a detailed explanation of both, including **definitions, examples, advantages, disadvantages, applications, time complexity, and space complexity**.

---

## **1. Difference between DFS and BFS**
### **Definition**
- **Depth-First Search (DFS):** An algorithm for traversing or searching tree or graph data structures. DFS explores as far as possible along one branch before backtracking.
- **Breadth-First Search (BFS):** An algorithm that explores all the neighbors of a node before moving to the next level in a hierarchical order.

### **Examples**
#### **DFS Example (Binary Tree Traversal)**
Consider a binary tree:
```
       A
      / \
     B   C
    / \   \
   D   E   F
```
DFS would explore in this order:
1. **Start at A**
2. **Go to B → D → (Backtrack) → E**
3. **Backtrack to A, then visit C → F**

Traversal Order: **A → B → D → E → C → F**

#### **BFS Example (Binary Tree Traversal)**
Using the same tree structure, BFS would explore:
1. **Visit A first**
2. **Visit B and C (children of A)**
3. **Visit D, E, and F (children of B and C)**

Traversal Order: **A → B → C → D → E → F**

## **2. Advantages and Disadvantages**
### **DFS Advantages**
✅ Uses less memory compared to BFS since it only stores the path nodes.  
✅ Efficient for solving puzzles like mazes.  
✅ Suitable for path-finding when the goal is deep within the graph/tree.

### **DFS Disadvantages**
❌ May get stuck in loops if cycles exist (requires cycle detection).  
❌ Does not guarantee the shortest path in unweighted graphs.  

### **BFS Advantages**
✅ Guarantees finding the shortest path in an unweighted graph.  
✅ Finds all connected nodes efficiently in a graph.  
✅ Works well for shortest path problems, like navigating maps.

### **BFS Disadvantages**
❌ Requires more memory since it stores all nodes at the current depth.  
❌ Can be slower for large graphs compared to DFS.

## **3. Applications of DFS and BFS**
### **DFS Applications**
📌 Solving mazes  
📌 Topological sorting  
📌 Detecting cycles in graphs  
📌 Searching hierarchical structures  
📌 Pathfinding in AI algorithms  

### **BFS Applications**
📌 Shortest path search (e.g., Google Maps)  
📌 Peer-to-peer networking (finding closest neighbors)  
📌 Web crawlers (finding new links in webpages)  
📌 Level-wise traversal in tree-based structures  
📌 Finding connected components in graphs

## **4. Time Complexity and Space Complexity**
### **DFS Complexity**
- **Time Complexity:** **O(V + E)** (where V = vertices, E = edges)
- **Space Complexity:** **O(V)** (for recursion stack or explicit stack storage)

### **BFS Complexity**
- **Time Complexity:** **O(V + E)** (since every vertex and edge is processed)
- **Space Complexity:** **O(V)** (stores all nodes at the current level in the queue)

---

### **Conclusion**
DFS and BFS are fundamental graph traversal algorithms with different applications. DFS is **memory-efficient** but does not guarantee the shortest path, while BFS **always finds the shortest path** but can be **memory-intensive**.
