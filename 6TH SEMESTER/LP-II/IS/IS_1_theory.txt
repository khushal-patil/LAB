Here are **crisp, viva-ready answers** to all the theory questions listed:

### üîê **Theory Answers**

#### **Basic Concepts**

1. **Difference between AND and XOR gates:**

   * **AND**: Outputs 1 only if both inputs are 1.
   * **XOR**: Outputs 1 if inputs are different (1,0 or 0,1).

2. **Why is 127 used in bitwise operation?**

   * 127 = `01111111` in binary. It's used to mask or modify the **7-bit ASCII** value, effectively removing the MSB (Most Significant Bit).
   ### üß† MSB Meaning

**MSB = Most Significant Bit**

* It is the **leftmost bit** in a binary number.
* Represents the **highest place value** (like the hundreds place in decimal).
* In an 8-bit number:

  * **MSB is bit 7** (indexing from 0)
  * Example:

    * `10000001` ‚Üí MSB = 1

---

### üîç Why MSB matters

* **In signed numbers** (like in two's complement), MSB indicates **sign**:

  * `0` ‚Üí Positive
  * `1` ‚Üí Negative
* Used in **bit masking, encryption, compression**, and **network protocols**.

3. **What is ASCII value and its role?**

   * ASCII assigns a numeric value to characters (e.g., 'A' = 65). Used here for bitwise operations on text.
   ### üî° ASCII: Quick Summary

**ASCII (American Standard Code for Information Interchange)**
A **7-bit character encoding** standard that maps **characters to numeric values** used by computers.

---

### üß† **Key Facts**

* **Total characters**: 128 (from 0 to 127)
* **Character Types**:

  * **0‚Äì31**: Control characters (e.g., `\n`, `\t`, `Backspace`)
  * **32‚Äì126**: Printable characters (letters, numbers, symbols)
  * **127**: DEL (delete character)

### üî¢ **Examples**

| Character | ASCII Decimal | Binary   |
| --------- | ------------- | -------- |
| A         | 65            | 01000001 |
| a         | 97            | 01100001 |
| 0         | 48            | 00110000 |
| Space     | 32            | 00100000 |
| !         | 33            | 00100001 |

### üí° Why ASCII matters

* It's the foundation for modern encodings like **UTF-8**.
* Enables **text processing**, **communication protocols**, **encryption**, and **programming**.
* ASCII values are used in **bitwise operations** for tasks like encoding, comparison, and security.

4. **How bitwise AND and XOR work:**

   * `AND`: Keeps bits that are 1 in **both** numbers.
   * `XOR`: Flips bits when bits differ.

5. **Use of `ord()` in Python:**

   * Converts a character to its ASCII value. Example: `ord('A')` ‚Üí 65.

---

#### **Program Understanding**

6. **Python code logic summary:**

   * Takes a string ‚Üí gets ASCII of each char ‚Üí performs `AND 127` and `XOR 127` ‚Üí prints results in table format.

7. **What happens if 127 is replaced with 255?**

   * `255 = 11111111`, so:

     * `AND` with 255 returns the **original ASCII**.
     * `XOR` with 255 **inverts all bits** of the character.

8. **Why XOR and AND give different results:**

   * `AND` filters bits.
   * `XOR` changes bits based on difference‚Äîacts like a toggler.

9. **Code modification for OR:**

   ```python
   or_result = ascii_value | 127
   print(f"{or_result:<10}")
   ```

10. **Why bitwise ops in security/data:**

    * Lightweight, fast.
    * Used in **encryption, hashing**, **data compression**, and **networking**.

---

#### **Advanced Thought**

11. **Use in encryption:**

    * XOR is a base of **symmetric encryption** (e.g., One-Time Pad).
    * `cipher = plain XOR key` ‚Üí reversible.

12. **Can we reverse XOR to get original?**

    * Yes. `Original = (cipher XOR 127)` if 127 was used in encryption.

13. **Real-world XOR applications:**

    * RAID parity, checksums, cryptography, error detection, toggling states.

14. **What if string has symbols/numbers?**

    * No issue. `ord()` handles them. Bitwise logic works on all ASCII.

15. **C vs Python implementation:**

    * C uses `char` and `int` explicitly.
    * Python is dynamic, simpler syntax.
    * In C:

      ```c
      printf("%c %d %d %d", c, c, c & 127, c ^ 127);
      ```

### üßÆ **Truth Table**

| A | B | A ‚äï B |
| - | - | ----- |
| 0 | 0 | 0     |
| 0 | 1 | 1     |
| 1 | 0 | 1     |

### üí° XOR Properties

* **Self-inverse**: `A ‚äï A = 0`
* **Identity**: `A ‚äï 0 = A`
* **Inversion**: `A ‚äï 1 = ¬¨A`
* **Reversible**: Used in encryption (e.g., `C = A ‚äï K`, then `A = C ‚äï K`)
