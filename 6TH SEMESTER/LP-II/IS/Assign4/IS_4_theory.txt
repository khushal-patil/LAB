Here is a comprehensive **theory-based Q\&A guide** based on your RSA encryption-decryption code, ideal for **viva/oral exams**:

---

### 🔐 **1. What is RSA Algorithm? Explain its Purpose.**

**Definition:**
RSA (Rivest–Shamir–Adleman) is a public-key cryptographic algorithm used for secure data transmission. It is based on the mathematical difficulty of factoring large prime numbers.

**Purpose:**
To encrypt and decrypt messages such that only the intended recipient can read the message, even if the public key is known.

**Applications:**

* Secure emails
* Digital signatures
* SSL/TLS in web security
* Blockchain (e.g., wallet keys)

---

### 🔣 **2. Explain the RSA Key Generation Process.**

**Steps in Code:**

1. **Choose two distinct primes**: `p`, `q`
2. **Compute `n = p * q`**: modulus for keys
3. **Calculate Euler’s Totient `phi = (p-1)(q-1)`**
4. **Choose `e`** such that `1 < e < phi` and `gcd(e, phi) = 1` (public exponent)
5. **Calculate `d`**: modular inverse of `e` modulo `phi`

   * i.e., `(e * d) % phi == 1` → private exponent

**Returned Keys:**

* Public key: `(e, n)`
* Private key: `(d, n)`

---

### 🧮 **3. What is the Role of `gcd` and `modInverse` Functions?**

* `gcd(a, b)`: Ensures `e` and `phi` are coprime for valid encryption.
* `modInverse(e, phi)`: Finds `d` such that encryption and decryption are inverse operations under modulo `phi`.

---

### ⚙️ **4. How Does Modular Exponentiation Work?**

**Function:** `power(base, expo, m)`
Performs fast exponentiation:

* Reduces time complexity from **O(e)** to **O(log e)**
* Essential for large numbers in RSA to prevent overflow and reduce time

**Used in:**

* `encrypt()` → $C = M^e \mod n$
* `decrypt()` → $M = C^d \mod n$

---

### 🧠 **5. Why Must `p` and `q` Be Prime Numbers?**

* Security of RSA relies on the fact that factoring `n = p * q` is hard.
* If `p` or `q` is not prime, `phi` calculation is incorrect, breaking the key generation and encryption.

---

### 📦 **6. Explain the Functions: `encrypt()` and `decrypt()`**

* `encrypt(m, e, n)` → Encrypts message `m` using public key
* `decrypt(c, d, n)` → Decrypts ciphertext `c` using private key

**Encryption Equation:**
$C = M^e \mod n$

**Decryption Equation:**
$M = C^d \mod n$

---

### 🧠 **7. What is Euler’s Totient Function and Why is it Used?**

**Euler’s Totient (φ):**
Number of integers less than `n` that are coprime to `n`.

In RSA,

$$
\phi(n) = (p-1)(q-1)
$$

Used to find a valid public exponent `e` and compute `d`.

---

### 🧮 **8. What is Time and Space Complexity of RSA Implementation?**

**Time Complexity:**

* Key generation (modInverse): O(φ)
* Encryption/Decryption (`power()`): O(log e) or O(log d)

**Space Complexity:**

* O(1) for scalar operations
* O(log n) if recursion/stack were used in `power()`

---

### ⚠️ **9. Limitations and Disadvantages of RSA**

* **Slow for large files**: Not ideal for large-scale encryption
* **Vulnerable to quantum attacks** (Shor’s algorithm)
* **Key length** must be large (2048+ bits) for modern security

---

### 📌 **10. What Happens If `modInverse()` Returns -1?**

* This means modular inverse doesn't exist → `e` is not coprime to `phi`.
* The system should raise an error or retry with a different `e`.

**********************************************************************************************************************
Example:---------
p = 7
q = 11
m = 3

n = p*q = 7 * 11 = 77
phi(n) = (p-1)(q-1) = 6 * 10 = 60
factor phi(n) = 2 * 2 * 3 * 5
here biggest is 5 and near to is 7 i.e. co-prime
e = 7
ed mod 60 = 1
61
121
181
241
301

here 301 is completely divided by e = 7 therefore
d = 301/7 = 43

#encryption ----
c = m^e mod(n)
  = 3^7 mod(77)
  = 2187 mod (77)
  = 31
#decryption -----
m = c^d mod(n)
  = 31^43 mod(77)
  = 3

### ✅ **Q1: What Are Possible Attacks on RSA Algorithm? Explain**

RSA is secure under proper use, but certain vulnerabilities exist:

#### **1. Factoring Attack**

* **Core weakness** of RSA lies in factoring `n = p × q`.
* Large `n` makes this computationally hard.
* **Example:** For small `n`, attackers can easily factor and break encryption.

#### **2. Low Public Exponent Attack**

* Using a small `e` (like `e = 3`) can leak information if the same message is sent to multiple recipients or is too small.

#### **3. Chosen Ciphertext Attack (CCA)**

* Attacker tricks system into decrypting selected ciphertexts, learning patterns or recovering keys.

#### **4. Timing Attack**

* By measuring how long decryption takes, attacker can infer bits of the private key.

#### **5. Man-in-the-Middle (MITM)**

* During key exchange, attacker intercepts and replaces keys to decrypt/modify messages.

#### ✅ Applications of Understanding These Attacks:

* Secure implementations (e.g., OAEP padding, large key sizes)
* Cybersecurity audits, cryptanalysis research, cryptographic protocol design

### ✅ **Q2: How Does RSA Work for M = 5, p = 11, q = 13? Solve It**

We walk through the RSA algorithm step-by-step:

#### **Step 1: Compute `n` and `ϕ(n)`**

* $n = p × q = 11 × 13 = 143$
* $ϕ(n) = (p-1)(q-1) = 10 × 12 = 120$

#### **Step 2: Choose Public Exponent `e`**

* Let’s choose `e = 7` (gcd(7, 120) = 1)

#### **Step 3: Compute Private Exponent `d`**

* Find `d` such that $(d × e) \mod 120 = 1$
* Try `d = 103` → $103 × 7 = 721 \mod 120 = 1$ ✅

#### **Step 4: Public and Private Keys**

* Public Key: $(e = 7, n = 143)$
* Private Key: $(d = 103, n = 143)$

---

#### **Encryption:**

Message $M = 5$

$$
C = M^e \mod n = 5^7 \mod 143 = 78125 \mod 143 = 101
$$

🔐 **Encrypted Ciphertext: `C = 101`**

---

#### **Decryption:**

$$
M = C^d \mod n = 101^{103} \mod 143
$$

Use modular exponentiation:

$$
M = 5
$$

🔓 **Decrypted Message: `M = 5`**
