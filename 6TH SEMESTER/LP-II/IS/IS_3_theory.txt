### 🔐 **S-AES Theory Questions & Answers**

#### 1. **What is Simplified AES (S-AES)?**

> A lightweight version of AES designed for educational use, operating on 16-bit plaintext and keys using simple S-Boxes, substitution, shift, and mix operations.

The full form of **AES** is:  

### **AES** – **Advanced Encryption Standard**  

### **Key Points about AES**:  
- It is a **symmetric-key block cipher** algorithm used for secure data encryption and decryption.  
- Developed by **Vincent Rijmen and Joan Daemen** (also called the **Rijndael cipher**).  
- Adopted by **NIST (National Institute of Standards and Technology)** in **2001** as a replacement for **DES (Data Encryption Standard)**.  
- Uses **fixed block sizes (128 bits)** and **key sizes (128, 192, or 256 bits)**.  
- Widely used in **SSL/TLS, VPNs, disk encryption (BitLocker), Wi-Fi security (WPA2/WPA3), and more**.  

### **AES Encryption Process**:  
1. **Key Expansion** – Derives round keys from the main key.  
2. **Initial Round** – **AddRoundKey** (XOR with the first round key).  
3. **Main Rounds (9, 11, or 13 rounds depending on key size)**:  
   - **SubBytes** (Non-linear substitution using S-boxes).  
   - **ShiftRows** (Transposition step).  
   - **MixColumns** (Mixing operation for diffusion).  
   - **AddRoundKey** (XOR with round key).  
4. **Final Round** (No MixColumns).  

### **Security Features**:  
✔ **Resistant to known attacks** (Brute-force is impractical for 256-bit keys).  
✔ **Efficient in both hardware & software**.  
✔ **Approved for top-secret government data (when using 192/256-bit keys)**.

---

#### 3. **What is a S-Box and its role?**

> S-Box (Substitution Box) replaces input nibbles with fixed outputs to introduce non-linearity and confusion in the cipher.

---

#### 4. **Explain the role of ShiftRows.**

> Shifts the second row (4-bit nibble) of the 2x2 matrix to the left, disrupting alignment to increase diffusion.

---

#### 5. **What is MixColumns and why is it used?**

> A matrix multiplication (in GF(2⁴)) that blends columns of the state matrix, providing inter-nibble diffusion.

---

#### 6. **What does the key expansion do?**

> Generates round keys (pre-round, round1, round2) from the original key using subWord, rotWord, and XOR with round constants.

---

#### 7. **Why use GF(2⁴) multiplication in MixColumns?**

> Ensures finite field arithmetic suitable for encryption where overflow is avoided and operations remain within 4 bits.

---

#### 8. **Why is AddRoundKey used multiple times?**

> XORs the state with round keys at different stages to combine key material with the plaintext and intermediate state.

---

#### 9. **What is the purpose of inverse operations in decryption?**

> Each encryption step has a corresponding inverse (e.g., Inverse S-Box, Inverse ShiftRows, Inverse MixColumns) to recover the original plaintext.

---

#### 10. **Why use XOR for AddRoundKey?**

> XOR is reversible: `A ⊕ B ⊕ B = A`, making it perfect for encryption/decryption where same operation can undo the change.

---

#### 11. **How is plaintext represented in S-AES?**

> As a 16-bit binary number, split into 4 nibbles (4 bits each) forming a 2x2 state matrix.

---

#### 12. **Explain the role of Rcon (Round Constant).**

> Used during key expansion to ensure variation and uniqueness across round keys, preventing linear key derivation.

---

#### 13. **What happens if MixColumns is skipped?**

> Diffusion decreases, making it easier to analyze patterns and compromise the cipher via differential cryptanalysis.

---

#### 14. **What are the security limitations of S-AES?**

> It's not secure for real-world use due to small key size (16-bit), simple structure, and low number of rounds—designed only for learning.

---

#### 15. **Compare S-AES with AES.**

| Feature    | S-AES       | AES              |
| ---------- | ----------- | ---------------- |
| Block Size | 16 bits     | 128 bits         |

Here’s a **laser-focused breakdown** of your **Simplified AES (S-AES) implementation**, tuned for **oral exams**, **interview panels**, or **viva** — built to impress and demonstrate mastery:

---

### 🔧 **1. Class Overview**

```python
class SimplifiedAES:
```

Defines a class implementing **S-AES**, a teaching-friendly 16-bit block cipher based on AES logic.

---

### 🔒 **2. S-Box and Inverse S-Box**

```python
sBox  = [...]       # For SubNibbles (non-linear substitution)
sBoxI = [...]       # For Inverse SubNibbles (decryption)
```

Performs **substitution** to add confusion (a core cryptographic property).

---

### 🔐 **3. Initialization & Key Expansion**

```python
def __init__(self, key):
    ...
    self.key_expansion(key)
```

* Takes a **16-bit key**
* Generates **3 round keys**:

  * Pre-round key
  * Round 1 key
  * Round 2 key

Key expansion uses:

* `rot_word()` – swaps 4-bit halves
* `sub_word()` – applies S-box
* `Rcon` – round constants to prevent symmetry

---

### 🔁 **4. Key Expansion Logic**

```python
def key_expansion(self, key):
```

Splits the key into 6 words: `w[0]` to `w[5]`. Then combines them into 3 round keys using:

* **XOR**, **rotations**, **substitutions**, and **round constants (Rcon1 = 0x80, Rcon2 = 0x30)**

Result: Three 16-bit round keys for 2 rounds + initial AddRoundKey.

---

### ⚙️ **5. Helper Methods**

```python
int_to_state(), state_to_int()
```

* Transforms a 16-bit int ↔ 2×2 nibble matrix (`[s0, s1, s2, s3]`)
* Helps apply operations like ShiftRows or MixColumns

---

### ➕ **6. AddRoundKey**

```python
def add_round_key(self, s1, s2):
    return [i ^ j for i, j in zip(s1, s2)]
```

XORs state with a round key — **reversible**, cheap, and secure.

---

### 🔄 **7. SubNibbles and Inverse**

```python
def sub_nibbles(self, sbox, state):
    return [sbox[nibble] for nibble in state]
```

Applies substitution for **non-linearity (confusion)**. Inverse used in decryption.

---

### 🔁 **8. ShiftRows**

```python
def shift_rows(self, state):
    return [state[0], state[1], state[3], state[2]]
```

Swaps 2nd row (nibbles 2 and 3) — introduces **diffusion** by rearranging bits.

---

### 🧪 **9. MixColumns**

```python
def mix_columns(self, state):
```

Matrix multiplication in GF(2⁴), using:

* `gf_mult()` — finite field multiplication using modulus `x⁴ + x + 1` (0b10011)
* Helps **spread bits (diffusion)** across columns.

---

### ↩️ **10. Inverse MixColumns**

```python
def inverse_mix_columns(self, state):
```

Performs reverse matrix multiplication for decryption using constants 9 and 2 in GF(2⁴).

---

### 🔒 **11. Encryption Process**

```python
def encrypt(self, plaintext):
```

**Steps:**

1. **Initial AddRoundKey**
2. SubNibbles → ShiftRows → MixColumns
3. AddRoundKey (Round 1)
4. SubNibbles → ShiftRows
5. AddRoundKey (Round 2)

Result: Encrypted 16-bit **ciphertext**

---

### 🔓 **12. Decryption Process**

```python
def decrypt(self, ciphertext):
```

Reverses encryption:

1. AddRoundKey (Round 2)
2. Inverse ShiftRows → Inverse SubNibbles
3. AddRoundKey (Round 1)
4. Inverse MixColumns
5. Inverse ShiftRows → Inverse SubNibbles
6. Final AddRoundKey (Pre-round)

Result: Recovered 16-bit **plaintext**

---

### 🧪 **13. User Input Section**

```python
plaintext = int(input(...), 2)
key = int(input(...), 2)
```

* Takes binary strings as input

### 🚨 1. **Possible Attacks on AES Algorithm**

Despite being highly secure when implemented correctly, AES can still be *theoretically* or *practically attacked* under certain conditions. Here's a brief rundown:

---

#### ✅ **A. Side-Channel Attacks**

* **Target**: Physical implementation (not the algorithm itself).
* **Examples**:

  * **Timing attacks**
  * **Power analysis**
  * **Electromagnetic leakage**
* **Defense**: Masking, constant-time execution, noise injection.

---

#### ✅ **B. Brute Force Attack**

* **Try all possible keys**
* AES-128 has **2¹²⁸ keys**, which is infeasible with current technology.
* **Defense**: Use AES-256 if extreme security is needed.

---

#### ✅ **C. Related-Key Attack**

* Attacker uses **pairs of plaintexts encrypted with related keys**
* AES is designed to resist this, but poor key schedules or reused keys can make it vulnerable.

---

#### ✅ **D. Known/Chosen Plaintext Attacks**

* **Known Plaintext**: Attacker has (plaintext, ciphertext) pairs.
* **Chosen Plaintext**: Attacker can encrypt arbitrary plaintexts.
* AES resists both via nonlinear S-box and strong diffusion.

---

#### ✅ **E. Algebraic & Cryptanalysis Attacks**

* Techniques like:

  * **Differential cryptanalysis**
  * **Linear cryptanalysis**
  * **Boomerang, Integral, or Biclique attacks**
* These are only effective on **reduced-round AES**, not full AES-128/192/256.
