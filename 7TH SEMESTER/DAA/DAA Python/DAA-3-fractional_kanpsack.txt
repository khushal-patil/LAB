## 1) Exact inputs to give (copy-paste into your program)

Use this interactive sequence when program prompts appear:

```
🔹 Fractional Knapsack using Greedy Method 🔹

Enter the number of items: 3

Enter the weight and value for each item:
Weight of item 1: 10
Value of item 1: 60
Weight of item 2: 20
Value of item 2: 100
Weight of item 3: 30
Value of item 3: 120

Enter knapsack capacity: 50
```

### Expected output (approx)

```
Maximum value in Knapsack = 240.00
Time taken = 0.0000xx seconds
```

(Your elapsed time will vary by machine; the value `240.00` is deterministic.)

---

## 2) Short worked example / dry run (why output = 240)

Items (value,weight) and ratio value/weight:

* Item1: (60,10) → ratio = 6.0 — take full (capacity left 40) → value += 60
* Item2: (100,20) → ratio = 5.0 — take full (capacity left 20) → value += 100
* Item3: (120,30) → ratio = 4.0 — capacity 20 < 30 → take fraction 20/30 = 2/3 → value += 120 * (2/3) = 80

Total value = 60 + 100 + 80 = **240.00**

---

## 3) Complexity (brief)

* Sorting by ratio: **O(n log n)**
* Single pass filling knapsack: **O(n)**
* **Overall:** **O(n log n)** time, **O(n)** space (to store items)

---

## 4) Quick improvements / exam tips (one-liners)

* Use stable sort; tie-breaking not required for correctness.
* For many queries, precompute ratios and reuse.
* If some item has weight 0 and positive value — handle explicitly (infinite ratio).
* For timing demos, run several iterations and show average.

## 5) Viva: most asked questions + short answers (memorize these)

1. **What is fractional knapsack?**
   Pick full or fractional items to maximize value under capacity.

2. **Greedy choice here?**
   Take item with maximum value/weight ratio first.

3. **Why greedy works here but not for 0/1 knapsack?**
   Fractional choices make the local optimum extendable to global; 0/1 has combinatorial constraints.

4. **Input / output of program?**
   Input: n, weights[], values[], capacity. Output: maximum achievable value (float).

5. **What does ratio mean?**
   Value per unit weight — benefit density.

6. **When do you take a fraction?**
   When remaining capacity < current item weight.

7. **Time complexity?**
   O(n log n).

8. **Space complexity?**
   O(n).

9. **Edge cases to handle?**
   Zero capacity, zero items, item with weight 0 (handle separately), negative values (usually invalid).

10. **How to prove optimality?**
    Exchange argument: replacing any lower-ratio part with higher-ratio part increases or keeps total value.

11. **What if items have equal ratio?**
    Any order among them yields same result.

12. **Real-world uses?**
    Resource allocation, cargo loading, fractional resource leasing.

13. **Difference b/w fractional and 0/1?**
    Fractional allows splitting; 0/1 does not — 0/1 requires DP for exact optimum.

14. **Can greedy be modified for integer knapsack?**
    No — greedy may fail; use dynamic programming or branch-and-bound.

15. **What data structure to use if items stream in?**
    Maintain a max-heap on ratio; extract as needed.

16. **Handling precision?**
    Use floats/doubles; print formatted to 2 decimals in practicals.

17. **If values and weights are large integers?**
    Use double precision or big integers for intermediate products if needed; but ratio is float.

18. **How to measure time fairly?**
    Use `time.perf_counter()` and average over multiple runs.

19. **What happens if total weights ≤ capacity?**
    Take all items — result = sum of all values.

20. **Why sort by ratio and not by value or weight alone?**
    Ratio captures benefit per unit weight — the right heuristic for capacity-constrained profit.

21. **Is greedy always fastest?**
    It's fast and optimal for fractional variant; complexity dominated by sorting.

22. **How to return selected fractions?**
    Record fraction taken per item (1.0 for full, <1.0 for partial) while iterating.

23. **What if item weight is zero and value>0?**
    The ratio is infinite — pick that first; handle separately to avoid division by zero.

24. **How to adapt to integer weights only?**
    Still fractional if you allow fractions; else use 0/1 knapsack DP.

25. **Can you compute an upper bound for 0/1 knapsack using fractional knapsack?**
    Yes — fractional solution gives an upper bound used in branch-and-bound.

26. **What is the greedy invariant?**
    After choosing k highest-ratio parts, the remaining capacity filled optimally by remaining items.

27. **What metric to print in practical?**
    Print max value, fractions chosen, and time taken.

28. **Implementation pitfalls?**
    Wrong sort key (use value/weight), integer division in some languages, division by zero.

29. **Why value/weight (not weight/value)?**
    We maximize value for limited weight; ratio must measure value per unit weight.

30. **How to demonstrate in viva?**
    Show sorted list by ratio, then stepwise filling, and final value (use n=3 example above).

Nice screenshot — let’s answer those three review questions cleanly and show a worked example using the table on the page.

### Given items

| Item | Weight | Value |     Value/Weight |
| ---- | -----: | ----: | ---------------: |
| 1    |      5 |    30 |  30/5 = **6.00** |
| 2    |     10 |    40 | 40/10 = **4.00** |
| 3    |     15 |    45 | 45/15 = **3.00** |
| 4    |     22 |    77 | 77/22 = **3.50** |
| 5    |     25 |    90 | 90/25 = **3.60** |

## 1) Realistic applications (brief)

* **Cargo loading / logistics:** maximize value of goods loaded into limited truck/container space (can take partial shipments).
* **Cloud resource allocation / bandwidth:** allocate fractional resources to multiple customers to maximize revenue/utilization.
  (Other quick examples: fractional investing, cutting-stock where pieces can be split.)

## 2) Explain Knapsack with example using greedy approach (worked example)

**Problem:** fractional knapsack — you may take fractions of items. Goal: maximize total value subject to capacity.
**Greedy rule:** pick items in descending order of **value/weight** (value per unit weight).

**Choose capacity = 50 (typical practical example).**

Step-by-step (sorted by ratio: 1 → 2 → 5 → 4 → 3):

1. Take **Item 1** fully (weight 5 ≤ 50).

   * Capacity left = 50 − 5 = **45**.
   * Value taken = **30**.

2. Take **Item 2** fully (weight 10 ≤ 45).

   * Capacity left = 45 − 10 = **35**.
   * Value taken = 30 + **40** = **70**.

3. Take **Item 5** fully (weight 25 ≤ 35).

   * Capacity left = 35 − 25 = **10**.
   * Value taken = 70 + **90** = **160**.

4. Next best is Item 4 (ratio 3.5) but weight 22 > remaining capacity 10 → take **fraction** = 10/22.

   * Value added = 77 * (10/22) = 77 * 0.454545... = **35.00** (exact: 3.5 * 10 = 35).
   * Capacity left = 0.
   * Final total value = 160 + 35 = **195.00**.

5. Item 3 not taken (no remaining capacity).

**Result:**

* Selected: Item1 (full), Item2 (full), Item5 (full), Item4 (10/22 fraction).
* **Maximum value = 195.00** for capacity 50.

## 3) Time complexity (brief)

* Main cost: sorting items by ratio → **O(n log n)**.
* Single linear scan to fill knapsack → **O(n)**.
  **Overall:** **O(n log n)** time, **O(n)** space (for items/ratios).
