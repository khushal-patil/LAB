```
♕ N-Queens Problem using Backtracking ♕

Enter the size of the chessboard (n x n): 8

Enter position of the first queen (row and column, starting from 0):
Row: 0
Column: 0
```

(Any valid `first_row, first_col` between `0` and `n-1` is accepted. Use the above to reproduce the example below.)

### 2) One best example (n = 8) — explanation + one valid solution

We place the first queen at (row 0, col 0). The program backtracks to place the remaining 7 queens so none attack each other.

One valid solution (one of the standard 8-queens solutions) is the queen columns per row:
`[0, 4, 7, 5, 2, 6, 1, 3]` — meaning:

Row0 → col0, Row1 → col4, Row2 → col7, Row3 → col5, Row4 → col2, Row5 → col6, Row6 → col1, Row7 → col3.

Matrix (1 = queen, 0 = empty):

```
1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0
0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1
0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0
0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0
0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0
0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0
0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0
```

**Why it’s valid:** no two queens share a row, column or diagonal:

* Columns are all distinct (0,4,7,5,2,6,1,3);
* Diagonals (r+c and r-c) are all unique for these positions.

Your program will print this (and any other solutions that fit the fixed first queen). If no solution exists for that first position, it prints “No valid solution found…”.

### 3) Short answers to the four theory questions (exam-ready)

**1) What is backtracking? Characteristics & applications**

* **Definition:** Systematic recursive search that builds partial solutions and abandons them (backtracks) when they cannot lead to full solutions.
* **Characteristics:** recursive, depth-first, explores solution space, uses pruning, can enumerate all solutions, usually exponential worst-case.
* **Applications:** N-Queens, Sudoku, crossword solvers, graph coloring, Hamiltonian path, subset-sum, constraint satisfaction problems.

**2) Explicit vs Implicit constraints (8-Queens)**

* **Explicit constraints:** stated in the problem and checked directly — e.g., “exactly one queen per row/column” (or “place n queens on n×n board”).
* **Implicit constraints:** derived from partial placements or problem logic — e.g., “no two queens may share a diagonal” becomes a condition that prunes branches during search (you check `r+c` and `r-c` conflicts).

**3) Compare space & time for Recursive vs Non-Recursive backtracking**

* **Time (both):** exponential in general (≈ O(b^d), b = branching factor, d = depth) — same asymptotic worst-case.
* **Space:**

  * *Recursive:* O(d) stack frames (system call stack) plus any auxiliary structures.
  * *Non-recursive (iterative with explicit stack):* O(d) for explicit stack.
* **Practical difference:** recursion simpler to code; iterative gives explicit control (can avoid recursion limits or reduce overhead in some languages). Both use similar memory order; both exponential time.

**4) Realistic applications (≥2)**

* **Constraint satisfaction**: layout and scheduling problems (e.g., register allocation, timetable scheduling).
* **Puzzle & AI solvers**: Sudoku, crossword filling, game move generation where legal positions must be enumerated/pruned.
  (Also: design validation, combinatorial test generation.)

### 4) Viva checklist — likely questions + short answers

Memorise these short lines:

1. **What is N-Queens?** Place n queens on n×n so none attack.
2. **Why backtracking here?** Must explore combinations and prune invalid partial boards.
3. **How do you check conflicts?** Keep sets for columns, r+c (positive diag), r−c (negative diag).
4. **Why skip `first_row` during recursion?** Because that row already has the forced queen.
5. **How do you record a solution?** When `r == n`, snapshot the board.
6. **How many solutions for n=8 normally?** 92 total symmetrically distinct placements (program may show fewer depending on fixed first queen).
7. **What pruning do we use?** Column and diagonal occupancy checks — O(1) per test.
8. **Time Complexity?** Exponential in n (roughly O(n! ) in worst dense branching; commonly estimated O(b^d)).
9. **Space Complexity?** O(n) for column/diagonal sets + recursion depth.
10. **How to make it faster?** Use symmetry breaks, bitmasking (for speed & memory), order heuristics (place row with fewer options first).
11. **Iterative vs recursive?** Same asymptotic cost; iterative avoids recursion depth limits.
12. **Can we count solutions without listing them?** Yes, same backtracking can increment a counter.
13. **How to print only one solution fast?** Stop after first found.
14. **What if first queen position makes no solution?** Program returns no solution — explain by showing a conflict that blocks all placements.

### 5) Small lab tips & demo script (2 minutes)

* Show your code, run with `n=8, first_row=0, first_col=0`.
* Display one solution matrix and explain r+c / r−c checks.
* If tutor asks about performance, mention exponential time and show n=10 to demonstrate slow growth.
* For extra credit: mention bitmask method (three integers for cols/diag1/diag2) for faster, low-memory implementation.
