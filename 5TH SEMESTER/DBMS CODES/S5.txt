 
Consider following Relation  
Employee(emp_id,employee_name,street,city) 
Works(employee_name,company_name,salary) 
Company(company_name,city) 
Manages(employee_name,manager_name) 
-- Employee table
CREATE TABLE Employee (
    emp_id INT PRIMARY KEY,
    employee_name VARCHAR(50) NOT NULL UNIQUE,
    street VARCHAR(50),
    city VARCHAR(50)
);

-- Company table
CREATE TABLE Company (
    company_name VARCHAR(50) PRIMARY KEY,
    city VARCHAR(50) NOT NULL
);

-- Works table
CREATE TABLE Works (
    employee_name VARCHAR(50) NOT NULL,
    company_name VARCHAR(50) NOT NULL,
    salary DECIMAL(10, 2) NOT NULL,
    FOREIGN KEY (employee_name) REFERENCES Employee(employee_name),
    FOREIGN KEY (company_name) REFERENCES Company(company_name)
);

-- Manages table
CREATE TABLE Manages (
    employee_name VARCHAR(50) NOT NULL,
    manager_name VARCHAR(50),
    FOREIGN KEY (employee_name) REFERENCES Employee(employee_name),
    FOREIGN KEY (manager_name) REFERENCES Employee(employee_name)
);
Create above tables with appropriate constraints like primary key, foreign key, not null etc.  
1.	Find the names of all employees who work for ‘TCS’. 
SELECT employee_name
FROM Works
WHERE company_name = 'TCS';
2.	Find the names and company names of all employees sorted in ascending order of company name and descending order of employee names of that company. 
SELECT employee_name, company_name
FROM Works
ORDER BY company_name ASC, employee_name DESC;
3.	Change the city of employee working with InfoSys to ‘Bangalore’
UPDATE Employee
SET city = 'Bangalore'
WHERE employee_name IN (
    SELECT employee_name
    FROM Works
    WHERE company_name = 'InfoSys'
); 
4.	Find the names, street address, and cities of residence for all employees who work for 'TechM' and earn more than $10,000.
SELECT E.employee_name, E.street, E.city
FROM Employee AS E
JOIN Works AS W ON E.employee_name = W.employee_name
WHERE W.company_name = 'TechM' AND W.salary > 10000; 
5.	Add Column Asset to Company table.
ALTER TABLE Company
ADD COLUMN Asset DECIMAL(15, 2);
