 
Consider following Relation  
Account (Acc_no, branch_name,balance) 
Branch(branch_name,branch_city,assets) 
Customer(cust_name,cust_street,cust_city) 
Depositor(cust_name,acc_no) 
Loan(loan_no,branch_name,amount) 
Borrower(cust_name,loan_no) 

-- Account table
CREATE TABLE Account (
    Acc_no INT PRIMARY KEY,
    branch_name VARCHAR(50) NOT NULL,
    balance DECIMAL(10, 2) NOT NULL,
    FOREIGN KEY (branch_name) REFERENCES Branch(branch_name)
);

-- Branch table
CREATE TABLE Branch (
    branch_name VARCHAR(50) PRIMARY KEY,
    branch_city VARCHAR(50) NOT NULL,
    assets DECIMAL(15, 2) NOT NULL
);

-- Customer table
CREATE TABLE Customer (
    cust_name VARCHAR(50) PRIMARY KEY,
    cust_street VARCHAR(50) NOT NULL,
    cust_city VARCHAR(50) NOT NULL
);

-- Depositor table (association between Customer and Account)
CREATE TABLE Depositor (
    cust_name VARCHAR(50),
    acc_no INT,
    PRIMARY KEY (cust_name, acc_no),
    FOREIGN KEY (cust_name) REFERENCES Customer(cust_name),
    FOREIGN KEY (acc_no) REFERENCES Account(Acc_no)
);

-- Loan table
CREATE TABLE Loan (
    loan_no INT PRIMARY KEY,
    branch_name VARCHAR(50) NOT NULL,
    amount DECIMAL(10, 2) NOT NULL,
    FOREIGN KEY (branch_name) REFERENCES Branch(branch_name)
);

-- Borrower table (association between Customer and Loan)
CREATE TABLE Borrower (
    cust_name VARCHAR(50),
    loan_no INT,
    PRIMARY KEY (cust_name, loan_no),
    FOREIGN KEY (cust_name) REFERENCES Customer(cust_name),
    FOREIGN KEY (loan_no) REFERENCES Loan(loan_no)
);

Create above tables with appropriate constraints like primary key, foreign key, not null etc. 
1.	Find the names of all branches in loan relation. 
SELECT DISTINCT branch_name FROM Loan;
2.	Find all loan numbers for loans made at ‘Wadia College’ Branch with loan amount > 12000. 
SELECT loan_no 
FROM Loan 
WHERE branch_name = 'Wadia College' AND amount > 12000;
3.	Find all customers who have a loan from bank. Find their names,loan_no and loan amount. 
SELECT Customer.cust_name, Loan.loan_no, Loan.amount
FROM Customer
JOIN Borrower ON Customer.cust_name = Borrower.cust_name
JOIN Loan ON Borrower.loan_no = Loan.loan_no;
4.	List all customers in alphabetical order who have loan from ‘Wadia College’ branch. 
SELECT Customer.cust_name 
FROM Customer
JOIN Borrower ON Customer.cust_name = Borrower.cust_name
JOIN Loan ON Borrower.loan_no = Loan.loan_no
WHERE Loan.branch_name = 'Wadia College'
ORDER BY Customer.cust_name;
5.	Display distinct cities of branch.
SELECT DISTINCT branch_city FROM Branch;
