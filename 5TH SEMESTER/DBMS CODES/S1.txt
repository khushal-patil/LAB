Create above tables with appropriate constraints like primary key, foreign key, not null etc. 
1.	Find the names of all branches in loan relation. 
SELECT DISTINCT branch_name FROM Loan;
2.	Find all loan numbers for loans made at ‘Wadia College’ Branch with loan amount > 12000. 
SELECT loan_no 
FROM Loan 
WHERE branch_name = 'Wadia College' AND amount > 12000;
3.	Find all customers who have a loan from bank. Find their names,loan_no and loan amount. 
SELECT Customer.cust_name, Loan.loan_no, Loan.amount
FROM Customer
JOIN Borrower ON Customer.cust_name = Borrower.cust_name
JOIN Loan ON Borrower.loan_no = Loan.loan_no;
4.	List all customers in alphabetical order who have loan from ‘Wadia College’ branch. 
SELECT Customer.cust_name 
FROM Customer
JOIN Borrower ON Customer.cust_name = Borrower.cust_name
JOIN Loan ON Borrower.loan_no = Loan.loan_no
WHERE Loan.branch_name = 'Wadia College'
ORDER BY Customer.cust_name;
5.	Display distinct cities of branch.
SELECT DISTINCT branch_city FROM Branch;
