 
Consider following Relation  
Account (Acc_no, branch_name,balance) 
Branch(branch_name,branch_city,assets) 
Customer(cust_name,cust_street,cust_city) 
Depositor(cust_name,acc_no) 
Loan(loan_no,branch_name,amount) 
Borrower(cust_name,loan_no) Execute the following query: 
1.	Create a View1 to display List all customers in alphabetical order who have loan from Pune_Station branch. 
CREATE VIEW View1 AS
SELECT Customer.cust_name
FROM Customer
JOIN Borrower ON Customer.cust_name = Borrower.cust_name
JOIN Loan ON Borrower.loan_no = Loan.loan_no
WHERE Loan.branch_name = 'Pune_Station'
ORDER BY Customer.cust_name;
2.	Create View2 on branch table by selecting any two columns and perform insert update delete operations. 
CREATE VIEW View2 AS
SELECT branch_name, branch_city
FROM Branch;
INSERT INTO View2 (branch_name, branch_city) VALUES ('New_Branch', 'New_City');
UPDATE View2
SET branch_city = 'Updated_City'
WHERE branch_name = 'New_Branch';
DELETE FROM View2
WHERE branch_name = 'New_Branch';
3.	Create View3 on borrower and depositor table by selecting any one column from each table perform insert update delete operations. 
CREATE VIEW View3 AS
SELECT Borrower.cust_name AS borrower_name, Depositor.acc_no AS depositor_acc_no
FROM Borrower JOIN Depositor ON Borrower.cust_name = Depositor.cust_name;
INSERT INTO View3 (borrower_name, depositor_acc_no) VALUES ('John Doe', 12345);
UPDATE View3
SET depositor_acc_no = 54321
WHERE borrower_name = 'John Doe';
DELETE FROM View3
WHERE borrower_name = 'John Doe';
4.	Create Union of left and right joint for all customers who have an account or loan or both at bank 
SELECT DISTINCT cust_name
FROM Depositor
LEFT JOIN Borrower ON Depositor.cust_name = Borrower.cust_name
UNION
SELECT DISTINCT cust_name
FROM Borrower
RIGHT JOIN Depositor ON Borrower.cust_name = Depositor.cust_name;
5.	Create Simple and Unique index. 
CREATE INDEX idx_customer_city ON Customer (cust_city);
        CREATE UNIQUE INDEX idx_branch_name ON Branch (branch_name);
6.	Display index Information. 
     SHOW INDEX FROM Customer;
     SHOW INDEX FROM Branch;
