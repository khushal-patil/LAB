 
Consider following Relation  
Account (Acc_no, branch_name,balance) 
Branch(branch_name,branch_city,assets) 
Customer(cust_name,cust_street,cust_city) 
Depositor(cust_name,acc_no) 
Loan(loan_no,branch_name,amount) 
Borrower(cust_name,loan_no) 

-- Account table
CREATE TABLE Account (
    Acc_no INT PRIMARY KEY,
    branch_name VARCHAR(50) NOT NULL,
    balance DECIMAL(10, 2) NOT NULL,
    FOREIGN KEY (branch_name) REFERENCES Branch(branch_name)
);

-- Branch table
CREATE TABLE Branch (
    branch_name VARCHAR(50) PRIMARY KEY,
    branch_city VARCHAR(50) NOT NULL,
    assets DECIMAL(15, 2) NOT NULL
);

-- Customer table
CREATE TABLE Customer (
    cust_name VARCHAR(50) PRIMARY KEY,
    cust_street VARCHAR(50) NOT NULL,
    cust_city VARCHAR(50) NOT NULL
);

-- Depositor table (association between Customer and Account)
CREATE TABLE Depositor (
    cust_name VARCHAR(50),
    acc_no INT,
    PRIMARY KEY (cust_name, acc_no),
    FOREIGN KEY (cust_name) REFERENCES Customer(cust_name),
    FOREIGN KEY (acc_no) REFERENCES Account(Acc_no)
);

-- Loan table
CREATE TABLE Loan (
    loan_no INT PRIMARY KEY,
    branch_name VARCHAR(50) NOT NULL,
    amount DECIMAL(10, 2) NOT NULL,
    FOREIGN KEY (branch_name) REFERENCES Branch(branch_name)
);

-- Borrower table (association between Customer and Loan)
CREATE TABLE Borrower (
    cust_name VARCHAR(50),
    loan_no INT,
    PRIMARY KEY (cust_name, loan_no),
    FOREIGN KEY (cust_name) REFERENCES Customer(cust_name),
    FOREIGN KEY (loan_no) REFERENCES Loan(loan_no)
);

Create above tables with appropriate constraints like primary key, foreign key, not null etc. 
1.	Find the branches where average account balance > 15000. 
SELECT branch_name
FROM Account
GROUP BY branch_name
HAVING AVG(balance) > 15000;
2.	Find number of tuples in customer relation. 
SELECT COUNT(*) AS num_of_customers
FROM Customer;
3.	Calculate total loan amount given by bank. 
SELECT SUM(amount) AS total_loan_amount
FROM Loan;
4.	Delete all loans with loan amount between 1300 and 1500. 
DELETE FROM Loan
WHERE amount BETWEEN 1300 AND 1500;
5.	Find the average account balance at each branch 
SELECT branch_name, AVG(balance) AS average_balance
FROM Account
GROUP BY branch_name;
6.	Find name of Customer and city where customer name starts with Letter P. 
SELECT cust_name, cust_city
FROM Customer
WHERE cust_name LIKE 'P%';
